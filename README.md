OMeta-PHP
=========

Brief Overview
--------------

OMeta-PHP is an implementation of OMeta with PHP as the hosting language.

OMeta is an object-oriented language for pattern-matching developed by Alessandro Warth and Ian Piumarta.
It is based on a variant of Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) which were extended to support matching on
arbitrary data types. OMeta's general-purpose pattern matching facilities provide a natural and convenient
way for programmers to implement tokenizers, parsers, visitors, and tree transformers, all of which can be
extended in interesting ways using familiar object-oriented mechanisms.
This makes OMeta particularly well-suited as a medium for experimenting with new designs
for programming languages and extensions to existing languages.
